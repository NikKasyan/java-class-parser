# WTF is this
This a raw Java class parser for java class files (.class). This is only a fun project to checkout the [Java SE specification 22](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se22/jvms22.pdf).

I might want to convert this into a Java Runtime at a later point. You might be asking why what anyone ever want to this, because I think it's fun.
